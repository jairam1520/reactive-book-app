Project Overview:
The Spring Boot-based Book Application is a robust system designed to manage book-related data efficiently. It utilizes Reactive Web Flux to handle asynchronous processing and offer scalable, non-blocking operations. The application serves as a RESTful API, allowing seamless interaction with book-related information stored in a MySQL database.

Key Features:
Reactive Web Flux: Utilizes reactive programming paradigms for handling concurrent requests efficiently, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness.

REST API: Employs a RESTful architecture, enabling users to interact with the system via well-defined endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book data.

MySQL Database Integration: Stores and manages book-related information using a MySQL database, ensuring data persistence and reliability.

Data Fetching: Implements mechanisms to fetch book data, utilizing reactive principles to handle requests asynchronously, enhancing system responsiveness.

Functionalities:
Book Retrieval: Users can retrieve book details by various parameters such as title, author, genre, etc., leveraging the API's search functionalities.

Data Modification: Allows for the addition, update, and deletion of books, ensuring that the database remains current and accurate.

Reactive Operations: Utilizes reactive programming concepts to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently, enhancing the system's scalability and performance.
